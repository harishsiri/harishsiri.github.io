<h2 class="main">Chandrayaan-2: Three steps closer to Moon, carrying NASA's Apollo 11 legacy<h2>
	<div class="para">
	India's Chandrayaan-2 is carrying laser reflectors to the Moon which enables to measure the distance between the Earth and the Moon. The spacecraft has completed three orbit-raising manoeuvres and here is the journey ahead for the mission. Taking forward the legacy of NASA’s Apollo 11 mission, India’s Chandrayaan-2 is carrying laser reflectors to the moon, which help in measuring the distance between the Earth and the Moon, reported Space.com. The Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft has now moved into a higher orbit after firing its onboard propulsion system, which makes it the third time it has raised its orbit as part of complex manoeuvers to reach the lunar surface.

	Chandrayaan-2 is scheduled to enter lunar orbit on August 20 and ‘soft land’ on the south polar region of the moon on September 7. But before all of that happens, the ISRO spacecraft has to clear several complicated procedures to reach its destination, as our most powerful launcher vehicle GSLV Mk-III does not have enough power to reach the moon in a single shot. Most of these manoeuvers will be performed in the first 25 days of the launch. During this time, the spacecraft will incrementally raise its orbit around the Earth, which will provide it with strength for the journey ahead.

	Chandrayaan-2 carrying laser reflectors to Moon

	In 1969, Apollo 11 astronauts left lunar lasers reflector on the moon that contained 100 small prisms. Scientists on Earth would shoot laser beams at these prisms to measure the distance between our planet and the Moon. Now, decades later, Chandrayaan-2 is also carrying laser reflectors on its mission to the moon, reported Space.com.
